# SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

## Overview

SHAP is a unified approach to explain machine learning model outputs using Shapley values from cooperative game theory. This skill provides comprehensive guidance for:

- Computing SHAP values for any model type
- Creating visualizations to understand feature importance
- Debugging and validating model behavior
- Analyzing fairness and bias
- Implementing explainable AI in production

SHAP works with all model types: tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Random Forest), deep learning models (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras), linear models, and black-box models.

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger this skill when users ask about**:
- "Explain which features are most important in my model"
- "Generate SHAP plots" (waterfall, beeswarm, bar, scatter, force, heatmap, etc.)
- "Why did my model make this prediction?"
- "Calculate SHAP values for my model"
- "Visualize feature importance using SHAP"
- "Debug my model's behavior" or "validate my model"
- "Check my model for bias" or "analyze fairness"
- "Compare feature importance across models"
- "Implement explainable AI" or "add explanations to my model"
- "Understand feature interactions"
- "Create model interpretation dashboard"

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Select the Right Explainer

**Decision Tree**:

1. **Tree-based model?** (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
   - Use `shap.TreeExplainer` (fast, exact)

2. **Deep neural network?** (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
   - Use `shap.DeepExplainer` or `shap.GradientExplainer`

3. **Linear model?** (Linear/Logistic Regression, GLMs)
   - Use `shap.LinearExplainer` (extremely fast)

4. **Any other model?** (SVMs, custom functions, black-box models)
   - Use `shap.KernelExplainer` (model-agnostic but slower)

5. **Unsure?**
   - Use `shap.Explainer` (automatically selects best algorithm)

**See `references/explainers.md` for detailed information on all explainer types.**

### Step 2: Compute SHAP Values

```python
import shap

# Example with tree-based model (XGBoost)
import xgboost as xgb

# Train model
model = xgb.XGBClassifier().fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create explainer
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)

# Compute SHAP values
shap_values = explainer(X_test)

# The shap_values object contains:
# - values: SHAP values (feature attributions)
# - base_values: Expected model output (baseline)
# - data: Original feature values
```

### Step 3: Visualize Results

**For Global Understanding** (entire dataset):
```python
# Beeswarm plot - shows feature importance with value distributions
shap.plots.beeswarm(shap_values, max_display=15)

# Bar plot - clean summary of feature importance
shap.plots.bar(shap_values)
```

**For Individual Predictions**:
```python
# Waterfall plot - detailed breakdown of single prediction
shap.plots.waterfall(shap_values[0])

# Force plot - additive force visualization
shap.plots.force(shap_values[0])
```

**For Feature Relationships**:
```python
# Scatter plot - feature-prediction relationship
shap.plots.scatter(shap_values[:, "Feature_Name"])

# Colored by another feature to show interactions
shap.plots.scatter(shap_values[:, "Age"], color=shap_values[:, "Education"])
```

**See `references/plots.md` for comprehensive guide on all plot types.**

## Core Workflows

This skill supports several common workflows. Choose the workflow that matches the current task.

### Workflow 1: Basic Model Explanation

shap_values = explainer(X_test)

# Step 3: Global importance
shap.plots.beeswarm(shap_values)

**See `references/workflows.md` for detailed production deployment workflow.**

## Key Concepts

### SHAP Values

**Definition**: SHAP values quantify each feature's contribution to a prediction, measured as the deviation from the expected model output (baseline).

**Properties**:
- **Additivity**: SHAP values sum to difference between prediction and baseline
- **Fairness**: Based on Shapley values from game theory
- **Consistency**: If a feature becomes more important, its SHAP value increases

**Interpretation**:
- Positive SHAP value → Feature pushes prediction higher
- Negative SHAP value → Feature pushes prediction lower
- Magnitude → Strength of feature's impact
- Sum of SHAP values → Total prediction change from baseline

**Example**:
```
Baseline (expected value): 0.30
Feature contributions (SHAP values):
  Age: +0.15
  Income: +0.10
  Education: -0.05
Final prediction: 0.30 + 0.15 + 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.50
```

### Background Data / Baseline

**Purpose**: Represents "typical" input to establish baseline expectations

**Selection**:
- Random sample from training data (50-1000 samples)
- Or use kmeans to select representative samples
- For DeepExplainer/KernelExplainer: 100-1000 samples balances accuracy and speed

**Impact**: Baseline affects SHAP value magnitudes but not relative importance

### Model Output Types

**Critical Consideration**: Understand what your model outputs

- **Raw output**: For regression or tree margins
- **Probability**: For classification probability
- **Log-odds**: For logistic regression (before sigmoid)

**Example**: XGBoost classifiers explain margin output (log-odds) by default. To explain probabilities, use `model_output="probability"` in TreeExplainer.

## Usage Guidelines

**When to load reference files**:
- Load `explainers.md` when user needs detailed information about specific explainer types or parameters
- Load `plots.md` when user needs detailed visualization guidance or exploring plot options
- Load `workflows.md` when user has complex multi-step tasks (debugging, fairness analysis, production deployment)
- Load `theory.md` when user asks about theoretical foundations, Shapley values, or mathematical details

**Default approach** (without loading references):
- Use this SKILL.md for basic explanations and quick start
- Provide standard workflows and common patterns
- Reference files are available if more detail is needed

**Loading references**:
```python
# To load reference files, use the Read tool with appropriate file path:
# /path/to/shap/references/explainers.md
# /path/to/shap/references/plots.md
# /path/to/shap/references/workflows.md
# /path/to/shap/references/theory.md
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Choose the right explainer**: Use specialized explainers (TreeExplainer, DeepExplainer, LinearExplainer) when possible; avoid KernelExplainer unless necessary

2. **Start global, then go local**: Begin with beeswarm/bar plots for overall understanding, then dive into waterfall/scatter plots for details

3. **Use multiple visualizations**: Different plots reveal different insights; combine global (beeswarm) + local (waterfall) + relationship (scatter) views

4. **Select appropriate background data**: Use 50-1000 representative samples from training data

5. **Understand model output units**: Know whether explaining probabilities, log-odds, or raw outputs

6. **Validate with domain knowledge**: SHAP shows model behavior; use domain expertise to interpret and validate

7. **Optimize for performance**: Sample subsets for visualization, batch for large datasets, cache explainers in production

8. **Check for data leakage**: Unexpectedly high feature importance may indicate data quality issues

9. **Consider feature correlations**: Use TreeExplainer's correlation-aware options or feature clustering for redundant features

10. **Remember SHAP shows association, not causation**: Use domain knowledge for causal interpretation
